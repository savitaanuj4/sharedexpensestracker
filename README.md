# sharedexpensestracker

Idea: The idea behind this project is "Who Paid For What?'' This project is useful to track expenses of self and friends when a single person pays some amount for something and we need to split the amount between each other.

Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Sqlite3

This is a DBMS based project where I performed some crud operations to manage the data.
It has two different dashboards, one for admin and another for generic user.
Admin can edit the detail of any user and can even delete it.
User can create any number of polls.
User can add expenses of himself and friends inside the different polls.
